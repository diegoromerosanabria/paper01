The results show that there was a significant difference in the use of Sustainable Agriculture System (SAS) practices by conventional and sustainable farmers. The response on two agriculture paradigms was significantly different among the two groups of farmers. The probit coefficient showed that there was positive relationship between farmers' education, number of new farming practices adopted, and SAS. The results suggest that sustainable farmers were younger and have more off-farm income compared to conventional farmers. It was also concluded that affiliations with different farmer groups/organizations does affect the farmer's perception toward SAS. The results of this study would be helpful to policy makers in developing strategies and policies to enhance SAS in order to improve the environment and rural communities.},

There is growing global demand for food and the National Food Plan has scoped the opportunity for Australia to increase the value of its agriculture and food related exports by 45\% by 2025. In order to realise this opportunity, Australia needs to increase its level of innovation and improve productivity in the agribusiness sector. It must needs to do this through better use of its finite resources through the adoption of more environmentally sustainable farming practices. This situation requires that Australia's rural sector must make a step change in its productivity. CSIRO's Sustainable Agriculture Flagship has set a national goal of increasing of increasing productivity in the sector by 50\% by 2030 while reducing net carbon emissions per unit of food and fibre by at least 50 per cent between now and 2030. The rollout of Australia's next generation broadband network and the growing impact of the digital economy through the adoption of smart digital services has the potential to help the rural sector meet its productivity and sustainability challenges. ... In order to demonstrate and evaluate the impact of these developments, CSIRO has helped establish a series of smart farming initiatives throughout Australia. The Australian Centre for Broadband Innovation (ACBI), a collaborative research run by CSIRO has worked with the University of New England (UNE) to set up the demonstration Kirby Smart Farm in Armidale in northern NSW to explore and demonstrate the impact of broadband and related digital services for Australia's rural sector.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion is a physical and economic problem of natural capital degradation. Even along an intertemporally efficient trajectory, one can have in a loss of soil fertility and a continuous decline of agricultural net revenue. Moreover, soil erosion is a major source of surface water pollution in rural areas. Erosion control is thus a challenge for sustainable resource management and internalizing external effects. To sustain the level of farm income, an `agricultural Hartwick rule' is proposed which addresses both on-farm and off-farm effects of soil erosion. First, it requires the investment of the soil rents into alternative capital. Second, additional measures are required to comply with an ambient quality target. A charge-subsidy scheme proves the most adequate from a perspective of cost-effectiveness and sustainability, if effluent charge revenues are earmarked to subsidize cropland retirement at the watershed scale. In combination with the investment of soil rents this enables to maintain the level of farm income constant over time while respecting the ambient quality target. Altogether, this fulfills the requirements of efficiency and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Differences between conventional and sustainable paradigms of agriculture are much more a matter of differences in farming philosophy than of farming practices or methods. The conventional model of agriculture is fundamentally an industrial development model which views farms as factories and considers fields, plants, and animals as production units. The goal of industrial development is to increase human well-being by increasing production of material goods and services and simultaneously increasing aggregate employment and incomes. The underlying assumption of the industrial model is that a higher quality of life can be derived from increases in income and consumption of goods and services. A fundamental strategy for industrial development has been to specialize, routinize, and mechanize agricultural production in order to achieve the economic effeciencies that are inherent in large-scale industrial production. New technologies are designed to remove physical and biological constraints to production and, thus, make unlimited progress possible. Sustainable agriculture, on the other hand, is based on a holistic paradigm or model of development which views production units as organisms that consist of many complex interrelated suborganisms, all of which have distinct physical, biological, and social limits. People are viewed as part of the organisms or systems from which they derive their well-being. Quality of life is considered to be a consequence of interrelationships among people and between people and the other physical and biological elements of their environment. Fundamental strategies for sustainable development include diversification, integration, and synthesis. Whole systems have qualities and characteristics that are not contained in their individual parts or components. The same set of components or parts may be rearranged spatially or sequentially resulting in a unique system or whole for each new arrangement. People increase their well-being by using information and knowledge to manage or rearrange the components of systems, resources, processes, and technologies in ways that enhance the productivity or `well-being' of those systems. Human progress is limited only by our ability to enhance the social, biological, and physical systems of which we are a part. Sustainable agriculture requires a holistic systems approach to farm resource management. A component approach focusing on individual farming practices, methods, and enterprises may have been appropriate for the era of agricultural industrialization. However, a systems approach which focuses on knowledge-based development of whole farms and communities will be required to address the environmental, economic, and social challenges of the post-industrial era of agricultural sustainability.},

  abstract = {The main aim of this paper is to apply mathematical programming and welfare maximization theory to analyze the effect of population growth on agriculture/forest land use competition, per capita cash income and subsistence consumption from privately owned farms as a basis to determine the economic sustainability of the present farming systems in the West Usambara Mountains. Two working hypotheses are presented: (1) given present population growth trends, present farming systems are not economically sustainable; (2) population growth will cause deforestation over time due to the expansion of farmlands. The analysis presented in this paper indicates that the present farming systems can sustain the present population growth rate (2.1\% per annum for Lukozi Village) and per capita income for a maximum duration of 25\textendash 30 years. Life expectancy in Tanzania is over 45 years (based on 1988 population census). Thus, the present farming systems cannot sustain even one human generation. This suggests that, for the existing farming systems to become economically sustainable, it is important to improve farming technology which could increase crop production through improvements of land productivity, and to increase income from other sources. Such a strategy will meet the increased food demand as a result of population growth as well as limiting the expansion of farmlands through forest clearing. In addition, the welfare of the farmers and rural populace could be enhanced and improved. Also, it might be relevant to expand small-scale industrial activities to increase income from off-farm activities.},

Despite its importance, resilience has seldom been directly considered in evaluations of economic sustainability. A whole-farm stochastic simulation model over a 6-year planning horizon was used to analyse organic and conventional cropping systems using a model of a representative farm in Eastern Norway. The relative economic sustainability of alternative systems under changing assumptions about future technology and price regimes was examined in terms of financial survival to the end of the planning period. The same alternatives were also compared in terms of stochastic efficiency. To model the risk of business failure adequately there is a need to deal with the risk of bankruptcy, and a modification of traditional analysis was used for that purpose. The organic farming system was found to be somewhat less economically sustainable than the conventional system, especially if the organic price premiums and the organic area payments were to be phased out. The results illustrate possible conflicts between pursuit of risk efficiency and economic sustainability. The model developed could be used to support farmers' choices between farming systems as well as to help policy makers develop more sharply targeted policies.},

  abstract = {Precision Livestock Farming (PLF) is spreading worldwide for its applications on livestock farms, in both intensive and extensive systems. PLF has started being adopted only recently, but the need of technological support on farm is getting more and more important and is facilitating its distribution on farms. A huge number of researches and scientific studies are available in literature about the adoption of technology, sensors and computer tools for almost all reared species. In this literature review, the goal is to study the recent progresses of PLF, and in particular the scientific studies carried out in the last 7 years (2013\textendash 2019) on dairy cattle farming. Health, welfare and production aspects were taken into account together with animal behaviour, environmental barn conditions and their effect on the three pillars of sustainability: environmental, economic and social. From the main findings, it can be underlined that PLF brings environmental, economic and social sustainability benefits on farms, but these benefits have not yet been quantified through specific methods for sustainability assessments. Therefore, it is important for near future researches to focus not only on the technological improvements of tools and sensors but also on the aspects of environmental, economic and social sustainability of livestock productions that impact on both farmers and the community and consumers. The role of PLF is more and more important and will support the process of decision-making of farmers, change their role on farm and their management view, and make possible the traceability of products and the control of the quality of products and of the animals living conditions as required from policy-makers and stakeholders.},

Another common change is that farmers become more aware of the ``organismal'' nature of the farm, which functions well when all its components are present and essential biological processes are supported through the careful management of events in time and space. The conversion process usually takes from three to six years. Because of the uniqueness of each situation and the changing nature of environments, there can be no reliable formulas for successful transition.

Analysis of sustainability necessarily involves the study of the dynamics of change in the stock of natural resources. To understand and analyse sustainability better it is important to be able to forecast the future consequences of current resource-use decisions. As the time frame involved may be long, and complex interactions among various parts of the farming systems need to be well understood, modelling is a good tool for studying such phenomena. Following consideration of the role of various types of models of farming systems as substitutes for, or complementary to, real-world experimentation, it is contended that bio-economic simulation models are well-suited for studying sustainability. A powerful tool to evaluate sustainability implications of alternative management practices is provided by the framework of optimal control theory. Some illustrative applications of modelling are presented and possible problems in applying such models in the context of developing countries are presented.},
